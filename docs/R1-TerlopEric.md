## How to Build a Web Developer Portfolio
This resource is an article that focuses on building a web developer portfolio. The article covers many different topics such as what a web developer portfolio is, why you need one, what you should include in your online portfolio, and more. Below are some key concepts that I found helpful from the article. 

* **What is a Web Developer Portfolio?**:<br>
A web developer portfolio is an online collection of your best web dev projects that accurately represent your skills, your abilities, and the quality of your work. It acts as a curated collection of your proudest professional web development examples you can show potential employers or clients to get yourself hired.

* **What Should Your Online Portfolio Include?**:<br>
When getting hired as a web developer, a portfolio of your best past projects is often a requirement. A resume has its time and place, but a portfolio is where you show (not tell) what you’re really capable of doing. Even when it’s not a requirement, a web development portfolio site can help you stand out. It demonstrates your commitment and dedication to showcasing your work. It’s also an opportunity for you to represent your work in the best light possible and show your personality.



* **What Should Your Online Portfolio Include?**:<br>
There are seven elements you absolutely need to include in your web developer portfolio site:

	1. Homepage
	2. Your skills
	3. Your projects
	4. About page
	5. Contact information
	6. Links to your projects on other platforms
	7. Links to your resume and social media profiles

## 8 Tips to Build an Outstanding Web Developer Portfolio
This resource is an article that focuses on explaining the importance of a portfolio and tips on what to include to make your portfolio more effective. The article explains that if you’re serious about your career in web development, you need your web developer portfolio at the ready. Below are some key concepts that I found helpful from the article.

* **Keep it simple**:<br>
You want your work to take center stage—and, that’s going to be tough if that prospective client can’t wade his or her way through all of those custom features you’ve added. You can still create a beautiful and impressive website without making it cluttered and complicated. Resist the temptation to do things just because you can, and instead focus on the things that actually add value to your website. That’ll help you skip the unnecessary features and add-ons and instead keep the most important thing in the spotlight: your work.

* **Always remember user experience**:<br>
Always keeping the experience of your user in mind not only makes your portfolio that much more impressive, but it also demonstrates that you emphasize that ever-important characteristic when coding other websites—which is something your prospective clients are going to look for.

* **Take advantage of your homepage**:<br>
You only get one chance to make a first impression, and this is exactly why the homepage of your web developer portfolio carries so much weight. Believe it or not, people are going to form an impression of your website after only 50 milliseconds (yes, that’s a real measure of time!). So, your homepage needs to immediately make the following clear:

 	* Who you are
 	* What you do

* **Be selective**:<br>
You’re proud of all of your work—and, that’s great. But, unfortunately, people are only going to spend 10-15 seconds reviewing your portfolio. That’s actually further incentive to make sure that you’re sharing your very best stuff—rather than every web development project dating back to 2008.

* **Share your personality**:<br>
Use a snappy but descriptive “about” page to give people the opportunity to learn more about you, your background, and your education. Don’t hesitate to also touch on what makes you who you are personally—whether it’s a love for the outdoors or a passion for rescue dogs. We touched on using an image of yourself on your homepage. But, whether or not you choose to include one there, you should absolutely include some sort of headshot on your “about” page. That way, prospective employers or clients will be able to put a face with your name. Finally, make sure to include links out to your other, relevant social media profiles. With those in place, people who are interested in finding out more about you on a more personal level will have a quick and easy way to dig into more of your online presence.

* **Make it easy to contact you**:<br>
The main goal of your portfolio is to land jobs. But, that’s going to be difficult if you don’t give interested parties any way to efficiently and effectively get in touch with you. When it comes to your portfolio, you need to make it blatantly obvious how people can contact you—often by including a designated “contact” page directly in your main navigation menu. As far as what goes on your “contact” page? If you feel the need to include a generic contact form, go ahead and do so. But, you should also include at least one additional way that visitors can get in touch with you—whether it’s an email address or a phone number.
