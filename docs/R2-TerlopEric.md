## 10 Effective Ways to Promote Your Website for Free
This resource is an article that focuses on the 10 best ways to promote your website for free. Some of the ways include solidify your website SEO, take advantage of email marketing, start a blog, post on forums, and more. Below are some key concepts that I found helpful from the article. 

- SEO, or search engine optimization, is one of the most effective ways to promote a website, as it helps improve a site’s ranking on Google and other search engines. Unlike paid search ads, SEO is totally free -  the competition is open to everyone, based on the quality of the content you publish, the fluidity of the navigation you offer to your visitors, and the number of links you receive from external sources. 


- You can achieve strong SEO by placing certain keywords and phrases throughout your website, adding alt text to your images and optimizing your headings so that your website can get found on search engines.

- There’s a reason you always see email marketing placed high up on articles that talk about how to drive traffic to your website. Why? Because it’s proven to be effective over and over. In fact, its average rate of return can be as high as 4400%, or $44 for every dollar spent.


- Newsletters are a particularly effective form of email marketing, since they are a direct form of communication between you and your potential customers. They also help you get subscribers and can help drive traffic to your site. To create an engaging newsletter, keep your content punchy and direct, and use prominent calls-to-action that encourage readers to click. That will help your content stand out from the sea of other newsletters your subscribers may receive.

- When considering how to promote your website, a good practice is to create a blog to bolster your SEO and increase your site’s rank on search engines. Blogging makes it easier for people to find your site and discover your business. On top of that, it helps you establish yourself as an authority in your field and can dramatically improve your conversion rate.


- Writing blog posts forces you to research your market, and in turn broadens your knowledge and professional skills. As for the technical side of starting a blog, Wix streamlines this process, making it easy to add a blog to your website.


- Even if you’re not much of a writer, you can still benefit from including a blog on your site, as it helps generate brand awareness and increase your website traffic.

- Social media isn’t just a way for your friends from high school to show off pictures of their children or snap photos of what they ate for lunch. It’s also an effective way to promote a website, as it helps businesses reach a diverse audience and build brand awareness.


- Whether it’s on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, social media marketing is important for engaging followers. Importantly, posting compelling content increases the chances that your audience will share it - which is free promotion for your website. And the more people click on your content, the more chances you'll have of getting website traffic and improving your conversion rate.


- Don’t forget to cross-promote so all of your networks benefit from as much of your content as possible. For instance, you can share your Instagram video to Twitter or your latest blog post on your Facebook page. You can also add a social bar to your website so that visitors can easily find your social profiles and share your content.

## How To Improve SEO Rankings in 2022
This resource is a web page that focuses on 11 steps to improve SEO rankings. Some of the steps include, improve page loading speed, produce high quality content, optimize your links, properly format your page, and more. Below are some key concepts that I found helpful from the article. 

- Your page loading time is important for a few reasons. First of all, if your load speed is too slow, Google will recognize this, and it will harm your ranking. But a slow website will also impact the way your website visitors engage with your pages. As a result, those negative interactions will hurt your ranking too.

- How often do you update your website? If you haven’t touched it since the day you built it, you probably don’t have a great SEO ranking right now. To drive more traffic to your website and increase its popularity, you need to give visitors a reason to keep coming back. Your content needs to be high quality, recent, and relevant. Another factor that impacts your SEO ranking is so-called dwell time. This relates to how much time people spend on your website per visit. If your site has fresh, exciting, or newsworthy information, it will keep visitors on your page longer and improve your dwell time. Websites that provide highly informative content typically have long dwell times.

- Blogging is great for your business. It’s an outstanding tool for lead generation and helps you engage with visitors to your website. But what most people don’t realize is blogging also improves SEO rankings. Here’s why. As I have already mentioned, producing fresh, updated, and relevant content can drive people to your website and give them a reason to stay on your pages for a while. Well, blogs are the perfect channel for you to accomplish this. If you can establish a large group of faithful readers, you can get lots of traffic to your site on a daily basis. Plus, you can incorporate other things I talked about so far into your posts as well, such as images and header tags. Other elements, such as links, increased readability, and keywords, can also be incorporated into these posts. I will talk about them shortly. All of this positively impacts your search engine ranking.

## What Is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?
This resource is an article that focuses on explaining what SEO is and how it works. Below are some key concepts that I found helpful from the article.

- SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

- Search engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web, going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly what you’re looking for at the time. Next, algorithms analyze pages in the index, taking into account hundreds of ranking factors or signals, to determine the order pages should appear in the search results for a given query. In our library analogy, the librarian has read every single book in the library and can tell you exactly which one will have the answers to your questions.

- SEO is a fundamental part of digital marketing because people conduct trillions of searches every year, often with commercial intent to find information about products and services. Search is often the primary source of digital traffic for brands and complements other marketing channels. Greater visibility and ranking higher in search results than your competition can have a material impact on your bottom line. However, the search results have been evolving over the past few years to give users more direct answers and information that is more likely to keep users on the results page instead of driving them to other websites.

- In sum, SEO is the foundation of a holistic marketing ecosystem. When you understand what your website users want, you can then implement that knowledge across your campaigns (paid and organic), across your website, across your social media properties, and more.

## The Best Website Traffic Analysis Tools (& How to Use Them)
This resource is an article that focuses on some of the best website traffic analysis tools and how to use them, the article also touches on mnay different topics such as what website traffic analysis is, how website traffic analysis tools work, benefits of website traffic analysis, and more. Below are some key concepts and notes that I found useful from this resource.

- Website traffic analysis is the process of collecting and interpreting key data points that describe web traffic to and from your site. (Web traffic is information about every user that visits your site.)

- Website traffic analysis tools work by measuring key metrics — datasets that highlight where your site is seeing success and where you may need to make improvements.

- Where do your visitors come from? Are they searching (and finding) your site organically or landing on your page via social media post, paid search, or email? While total traffic numbers offer a general picture of site success, tracing traffic sources helps identify specific successes and highlight potential problems.

- Page views show how many times users have visited a specific page on your website. This helps pinpoint the most popular pages on your site and allows you to use them as templates for underperforming areas.

- The visit metric showcases the total number of visits to your site, and accounts for both new and returning visitors. While this is a great metric for showing total growth over time, it’s not the best indicator of sales or lead generation — since every visit from every source is counted, regardless of what action they take (or don’t) on your site.

- Unique visits give you a better indication of website success, since it only counts the first (and, therefore, unique) visit of any user. Even if users return to your website every day, only their first visit counts. This helps you separate brand loyalists from prospective customers.

- Website traffic analysis provides visibility into current and emerging patterns and metrics that directly impact your website's success. There are many benefits to traffic analysis, but here are three key advantages target market development, spend-to-sales ratio, and lead generation success.

- Great website traffic analysis doesn’t just happen — thankfully, there are a host of great tools available online to help measure, monitor, and manage your website traffic. Some great tools include HubSpot CMS, Mouseflow, SimilarWeb, Semrush, Google Analytics, and more.

- The more you know about your traffic analytics, the more effective and impactful your website can be. Equipped with the right website traffic analysis tools, you'll identify your top site pages, track visitor trends, calculate conversion rates, and ensure your marketing spend translates into an increase in conversions and sales.
